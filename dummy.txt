factoryContract creates a unique Abstract Account Contract for each Wusre, 

A user wants to withdraw in a dApp that leverages Account Abstraction and gas sponsorship.
 The app has a *withdraw* contract,
  and a *Paymaster* contract is set up to sponsor gas for withdraw transactions


in erc4337 -> transaction = userOp

  Components Involved:

User (and Wallet/DApp UI): The person interacting with the dApp. Their wallet manages *their Abstract Account* and handles signing User Operations. The DApp UI provides the interface for interaction.

Abstract Account Contract (User Account): The smart contract representing the user's account. It has custom logic for validation and execution.

Target Contract (withdraw Contract): The smart contract the user ultimately wants to interact with 

Paymaster Contract: A smart contract deployed to sponsor gas for specific User Operations (e.g., withdraw).

Bundler Service: An off-chain service that collects User Operations, packages them into Ethereum transactions, and submits them to the EntryPoint.

EntryPoint Contract: The central contract in Account Abstraction, responsible for receiving bundled transactions, validating User Operations, and executing them.




**/*/*/*/*/*-/*//*/*/*/--*//
User initiates action in DApp UI.

DApp UI constructs and signs a UserOperation.

UserOp is sent to a Bundler.

Bundler pays gas and submits a transaction to the EntryPoint.

EntryPoint orchestrates validation with Paymaster and User Account.

User Account executes the intended action by calling the Target Contract.

User gets gas sponsorship via the Paymaster, without directly paying ETH for gas.
